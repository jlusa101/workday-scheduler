# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice using JQuery, Bootstrap, and moment.js. 
This source file contains a workday scheduler that allows the user to plan their day
on a typical work day from 9 AM -  5 PM.

## Instructions
When the user enters the website, they are presented with a title and the current date.
When they scroll down, they can see time blocks ranging from 9 AM to 5 PM.
The user can also see that the time blocks are color coded depending if the time is in
the past, current, or future.
The user can enter their event in the middle textbox.
The user can then click the save button on right side that will save the event in the local storage.
When the user closes or refreshes the page, they can see that the events are still where they were placed.
If the user wishes to delete an event, they need to clear the middle textbox and click the save button again. This will delete the event from local storage and will not appear again.

* Past - Gray
* Current - Red
* Future - Green

## Future Considerations
In the future, the workday scheduler might contain events that are time stamped to ensure that they don't end up on the next days workday scheduler.

## Built With
